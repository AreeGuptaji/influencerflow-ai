# Contract Generation System Specification

## Overview

The contract generation system will automatically create legally-sound contracts based on negotiated terms between brands and creators. This system eliminates manual contract drafting and ensures consistent, comprehensive agreements for all campaigns.

## User Stories

1. As a brand, I want contracts to be automatically generated from negotiated terms
2. As a brand, I want to review and edit contracts before finalizing
3. As a brand, I want to download contracts as PDF documents
4. As a brand, I want to send contracts to creators for electronic signature
5. As a brand, I want to track contract status (draft, sent, signed, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Contract Generation Process

1. Negotiation completion → Extract deal terms → Generate contract from template
2. Brand review → Optional edits → Finalize contract
3. Send to creator → Electronic signature → Store completed contract

### Components

#### Backend Components:

1. **Contract API Routes:**

   - `src/app/api/campaigns/[id]/contracts` - Contract management endpoint
   - `src/app/api/contracts/generate` - Contract generation endpoint
   - `src/app/api/contracts/[id]/pdf` - PDF generation endpoint

2. **Contract Generation Logic:**

   - Template-based generation with dynamic sections
   - Legal clause library for different campaign types
   - Term validation to ensure completeness
   - Variable substitution for personalization

3. **PDF Generation Service:**
   - React-PDF for document generation
   - Template styling for professional appearance
   - Digital signature integration
   - Secure document storage

#### Frontend Components:

1. **Contract Management Interface:**

   - Location: `src/app/campaigns/[id]/contracts/page.tsx`
   - Contract status dashboard
   - List of all campaign contracts
   - Filtering and sorting options

2. **Contract Editor:**

   - Location: `src/app/campaigns/[id]/contracts/[contractId]/page.tsx`
   - Editable contract sections
   - Preview mode with proper formatting
   - PDF download option
   - Send for signature functionality

3. **Contract Templates:**
   - Standard influencer agreement
   - Specialized templates (product review, sponsored content, etc.)
   - Customizable sections based on negotiation terms

### Database Schema Updates

```typescript
// Contract model
model Contract {
  id              String          @id @default(cuid())
  campaignId      String
  creatorId       String
  negotiationId   String?
  status          ContractStatus  // DRAFT, SENT, SIGNED, CANCELED
  content         String          // Full contract content
  version         Int             @default(1)
  signedByBrand   Boolean         @default(false)
  signedByCreator Boolean         @default(false)
  brandSignedAt   DateTime?
  creatorSignedAt DateTime?
  pdfUrl          String?
  createdAt       DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime        @updatedAt

  campaign        Campaign        @relation(fields: [campaignId], references: [id])
  negotiation     Negotiation?    @relation(fields: [negotiationId], references: [id])
}

// ContractTemplate model
model ContractTemplate {
  id              String          @id @default(cuid())
  name            String
  description     String
  content         String
  variables       String[]        // Variables that can be substituted
  isDefault       Boolean         @default(false)
  createdAt       DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime        @updatedAt
}

// ContractClause library
model ContractClause {
  id              String          @id @default(cuid())
  name            String
  category        String          // e.g., "payment", "deliverables", "rights"
  content         String
  isRequired      Boolean         @default(false)
  createdAt       DateTime        @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime        @updatedAt
}
```

### Contract Generation Flow

1. **Term Extraction:**

   - Extract negotiated terms from completed negotiation
   - Validate completeness of terms
   - Map terms to contract variables

2. **Template Selection:**

   - Select appropriate template based on campaign type
   - Load required and optional clauses
   - Prepare template with variables

3. **Content Generation:**

   - Fill template with extracted terms
   - Insert appropriate legal clauses
   - Format content for readability
   - Generate preview for brand review

4. **Finalization:**
   - Brand reviews and optionally edits contract
   - PDF is generated for download and sharing
   - Contract is sent to creator for signature
   - Signed contract is stored and linked to campaign

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Contracts are correctly generated from negotiated terms
- ✅ Generated contracts include all necessary legal clauses
- ✅ Brands can review, edit, and finalize contracts
- ✅ PDF generation produces professional-looking documents
- ✅ Contract status tracking works correctly
- ✅ E-signature integration functions properly

## Legal Considerations

- Standard contract templates should be reviewed by legal counsel
- Disclaimer about not providing legal advice
- Terms and conditions for contract use
- Jurisdiction and governing law specifications
