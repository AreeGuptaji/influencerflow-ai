# AI Matching System Specification

## Overview

The AI matching system will automatically recommend relevant creators to brands based on campaign criteria. This is a core feature that helps brands find the right creators for their campaigns quickly and efficiently.

## User Stories

1. As a brand, I want to get creator recommendations based on my campaign criteria
2. As a brand, I want to see why a creator is being recommended for my campaign
3. As a brand, I want to be able to add recommended creators to my campaign
4. As a brand, I want to filter and sort recommendations by different metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Matching Algorithm

The matching system will consider the following factors:

- Content niche alignment (primary matching factor)
- Follower count within specified range
- Engagement rate thresholds
- Location preferences if specified
- Content style and quality (future enhancement)

### Data Flow

1. Campaign criteria → API endpoint → Matching algorithm → Recommended creators
2. Brands can review recommendations and add creators to their campaign
3. Selected creators will be added to the campaign's selectedCreators list

### Components

1. **Backend API Route:**

   - Location: `src/app/api/campaigns/[id]/recommended-creators`
   - Functionality: Query database for creators matching campaign criteria
   - Return: Sorted list of creators with match score and reasoning

2. **Frontend Components:**
   - Location: `src/app/campaigns/[id]/recommended/page.tsx`
   - UI: Grid view of creator cards with match scores, metrics, and reasoning
   - Actions: Add to campaign, view profile, filter/sort results

### Database Requirements

- Add a RecommendedCreator model to track recommendations
- Implement a matching score calculation function in the API

### UI/UX

- Creator cards should display:
  - Profile image and name
  - Match score (percentage)
  - Key metrics (followers, engagement, etc.)
  - Matching factors (why recommended)
  - Action button to add to campaign

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Algorithm recommends relevant creators based on at least 3 factors
- ✅ Recommendations include clear explanation for why a creator was matched
- ✅ Brands can add recommended creators to their campaigns with one click
- ✅ Interface provides sorting and filtering options for recommendations

## Dependencies

- Complete campaign creation functionality
- Robust creator database with metrics
- API routes for creator database queries

## Implementation Timeline

1. Backend matching algorithm (3 days)
2. API endpoint development (2 days)
3. Frontend UI implementation (3 days)
4. Testing and refinement (2 days)

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning to improve match quality over time
- Engagement prediction based on historical performance
- Content style matching using AI analysis
- Recommendation explanations in natural language
